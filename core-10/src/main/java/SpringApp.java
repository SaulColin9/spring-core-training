// TODO
// 1. Copy all files from previous project.
// 2. Create a new annotation @Specification to apply it only on fields and methods
// 3. Create enum CarSpecification with values of BASIC, EXTENDED, PLUS, PREMIUM, LUXURY, LIMITED
// 4. Add CarSpecification field to each car bean and mark it with @Specification annotation
// 5. Find a way to fill those fields with random values, bound by the lowest and the highest limit
// of values and without touching beans. F.e. I want FordBronco to be created only with EXTENDED,
// PLUS or PREMIUM spec. Or I want ChevroletCamaro to have only LUXURY or LIMITED spec. Without limits
// it should be random from all the range.
